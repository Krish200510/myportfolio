- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and form handling. (Located in `./assets/js/script.js`)

## Customization

You can customize the following sections:

- **About Me**: Update the `<section class="about-text">` in `index.html` to reflect your personal details and experiences.
- **Resume**: Modify the `<section class="timeline">` sections to add or update your educational and professional experiences.
- **Portfolio**: Add new projects by modifying the `<ul class="project-list">` in the `index.html` file. Include project details and links.
- **Contact Form**: Ensure that the form's `action` attribute in `index.html` points to a valid form handling endpoint. You can replace the URL in `form` action with your preferred backend service.

## JavaScript Form Handling

The contact form uses the Fetch API to submit data. The script in `./assets/js/script.js` handles the form submission and redirects to a thank-you page upon successful submission. Make sure to update the `action` attribute of the form and the access key in the script to match your configuration.
